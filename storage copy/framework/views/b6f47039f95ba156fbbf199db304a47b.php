                At this stage, you will collect all the information that will be required for decision making in the next stages. Information collected during the research will become your raw material to strategize & create your digital marketing campaign. This stage can also be called as Digital Marketing Research. At this stage, you will research 4 sets of information:

                About Business
                About Your Target Customers
                About The Product That You Want To Market
                About Online Competition
                Each set is unique & equally important. You will require multiple sources to collect the information.

            <div class="tab-pane fade slide-section" id="pills-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-profile-tab" tabindex="0">
                <p>Create</p>
                <br>
                Once you collect information at the research stage, you can now start creating:
                1 – Digital Marketing Objectives / Goals: These are the ultimate goals that you want to achieve through your Digital Marketing Campaign. Every business is unique, therefore their goals will also be unique. Campaigns without clear goals will end up spending money without the assurance of achieving goals. What goals you should set, can be answered after looking at information collected at the Digital Marketing Research stage.  Learn more about Digital Marketing Objectives / Goals.

                2 – Digital Marketing Strategy: After you set the goals, it’s time to create a strategy to achieve those goals. Your Digital Marketing Strategy will include Positioning Strategy, Branding Strategy, Content Strategy, Digital Marketing Channels Strategy. What strategy should be adapted/created, will be answered from the information collected at the Digital Marketing Research stage.

                3 – Digital Marketing Plan: At this stage, you will lay down a documented plan that will include all your detailed Digital Marketing activities with timelines.

                4 – Creating Primary Digital Identities: The 3 primary Digital Identities of business are Website, Blog & App. These are like your online office, shops, or showrooms. These are the places where you want your target customer to reach & ultimately buy your products & services. Before you move on to the next stage, i.e promote, your primary digital identities must be fully ready. For businesses that want to sell their products through major E-Commerce portals, creating digital identities can be optional. But, it’s better to at least have a website for establishing some credibility of your business.

                After your primary digital identities are fully ready, you will start promoting them. That means you want relevant people to start coming to your primary digital identities. This is also called as generating relevant traffic. Relevant traffic is an important word here.

                The more you get relevant traffic to your website, the more the conversion you can expect. Your options to promote your website/blog / app will be:

                Search Engines
                Display Network
                Ecommerce Portals
                Social Media
                Email
                Messaging
                Affiliate
                The above are also known as Digital Marketing Channels, which you need to promote your Primary Digital Identities (Website / Blog / App). There are sub-channels & networks within some of the channels mentioned above.

                Which channels, subchannels, networks to go for & whether to do organic or inorganic promotions, these questions will already be answered at the Digital Marketing Strategy creation stage.

                    Once you create your primary digital identities & start promoting them through various digital marketing channels, it’s time to start monitoring your performance. Analyzing is like looking at the outcome of your digital marketing work. You will receive analytics for your primary digital identities, as well as the channels through which you have done the promotions.

                    The most important & ultimate analytics for any business is the analytics of your website/blog / app. Google Analytics is widely popular to generate analytics of your primary digital identities. The 4 major sections of Google Analytics are:

                    Audiences
                    Acquisition
                    Behavior
                    Conversion
